> Welcome to [DevOps Roast](https://devops-roast.com) — we roast your infrastructure 🔥
> so it doesn’t burn you later.

## 🌍 Who Are We?

We’re a consultancy and open-source collective focused on **helping teams avoid
DevOps disasters**. Our approach is simple: we **roast** your infrastructure,
highlight the risks, and then work with you to fix them using golden paths and
proven practices.

Whether you’re a fast-moving startup or a growing enterprise, we’ll help you
transform “it works on my machine” into **production-grade, automated, and
secure infrastructure**.

## 🚀 What We Do

- **Infrastructure Roast Reports** → Audits that identify anti-patterns, weak
  points and risks in AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD.
- **Golden Paths** → Standardized, opinionated infrastructure modules and
  playbooks.
- **Consultancy** → Hands-on help to fix and scale your infrastructure.
- **Open Source** → Modules, tooling, and engineering handbooks for the
  community.

## 🔥 Why “Roast”?

Because too many companies run infrastructure that’s barely holding together.
We believe the best way to improve is with a little tough love — **pointing out
what’s broken, then helping you fix it**. It’s not just critique. It’s critique
with solutions.
